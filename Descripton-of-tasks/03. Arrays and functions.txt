Purpose
This week we will focus two new building blocks: Arrays and functions. The program you write will use variables and loops from last week together with these two new features.
Instructions
1. Create a CLion-project called hand-in_3_1 inside your hand-ins folder
Make sure hand-in_3_1 is also added to the end of the path: hand-ins/hand-in_3_1
2. Write a program that reads in 10 integers, then:
   1. Prints out the lowest value:
Minimum: 5
   2. Prints out the highest value:
Maximum: 12
   3. Prints out the sum of all the values
Sum: 78
   4. Prints out the average (make sure you use %g with printf):
Average: 15.6
   5. Optional: Prints out the numbers, sorted
Sorted: 1 4 5
   6. Optional: Prints out the median
Median: 4.2
      1. Commit the code to Git from CLion
      2. Push the code to Bitbucket from CLion
      3. Check Bamboo to see if your code passes


Requirements: Minimum, maximum, sum and average must be calculated using functions you write, not directly in main. Here is a quick example of a function (more in the lecture):


int add(int num1, int num2)
{
        return num1 + num2;
}


Approach: Try to work on one part at a time, same as last week. I recommend starting with reading in ten numbers and printing them back to make sure that part is working before you continue. Then write function for a, b, c and d, one at a time. Don’t start on multiple things at once, build often, test often!


Tip: For the sorting have a look at qsort, which already exists in the standard library. If you want to sort manually then bubble sort might be the easiest.
